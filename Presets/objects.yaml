# objects.yaml
# lists objects that can be instantiated
# 
# supported object types:
#     token: generic object. 1 or two faces, can be moved.
#     card: token, but has 2 faces and when dragged onto another card, a stack is formed.
#     text_die: like token, has 1 face that is shown for all results, with text rendered on top
#     image_die: like die, but has a face for every roll possible
#     pile: a source that contains a limted or unlimited number of the same object.
#     stack: a source that contains a fixed number of entities in a certain order.
#
# - example_object: #contains all valid fields, as if it were all types. a real object should not do this.

#     front_face: "path to front face image"    #should be given for tokens, cards, and image_dice
#     back_face: "path to back face image"      # should be given for cards. optional for tokens (if omitted, will be same as front face)
#     text_rolls:        #for text_die. list of rolls possible, as strings. to be rendered as text
